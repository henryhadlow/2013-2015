	Lasting Power of Attorney&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;radically simplifying one of the government&apos;s most complex legal processes

<p>The previous process involved fourteen separate forms and guidance documents totaling over 200 pages.</p>

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Image of the existing LPA forms" src="{{ site.url }}/static/img/work/lasting-power-of-attorney/02.jpg" />

<p>We completely rethought the whole process. Now there are three forms (one is optional) and just one guidance document.</p>

<p>We rewrote all the text making it simpler and clearer, and removing as much legal jargon as possible.</p>
