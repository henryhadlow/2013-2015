<h1>Sprint 13&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;showcasing the best of digital from across&nbsp;government</h1>

<p class="description">Sprint 13 was a conference about <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" alt="Agile software development methods" target="_blank" class="stealth-link">agile</a> for civil servants. <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk" alt="The Government Digital Service blog" target="_blank" class="stealth-link">GDS</a> also set the ambitious goal of creating 25 exemplar digital services in the next 2 years. This is a daunting prospect for the departments involved &ndash; for many it means completely remaking their database systems and back offices.</p>

<p>The conference marked a huge change in the way the government is commissioning and running technology projects. We wanted it to have a completely fresh feel.</p>

<p>Simple and flexible branding allowed us to create many different applications quickly. We considered all the small details &ndash; the lanyards were individually printed with the attendees' names and showed the agenda on the inside. Custom signage throughout the venue helped people move around easily and get the most out of a packed morning.
