<h1>Lollipop Bakery&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Beijing's first cupcake&nbsp;bakery</h1>

<p class="description">I was asked to create an identity for The Lollipop Bakery, a cupcake bakery in Beijing. I created all spects of the identity, from the website and packaging right down to suggesting shapes to decorate the cakes.</p>

{% include video.html youtube-key="SAxruwRRqsg" title="Lollipop Bakery animated logo &ndash; YouTube" autoplay="true" %}

<p>The branding is primarily visual, intended to cross the language barrier. The logo resembles both a cupcake and a lollipop, and incorporating flower and heart motifs.</p>

<!-- <p>Elements from the mark can be cut from coloured icing and placed atop the cakes, creating a key to the flavours on offer.</p> -->

<p>The website uses a simple text block over an image which fills the browser window, forming a slide-show featuring the many cake flavours on offer.</p>
