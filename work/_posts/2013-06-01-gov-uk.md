GOV.UK marks a huge change in the way the government is interacting with citizens and buying technology. We&apos;re doing things the way they always should&apos;ve been done &endash; putting the user first and running projects on a fraction of former budgets.

We&apos;re working towards a strong typographic style which lets the structure of the information define each page. To make sure everything works perfectly, we&apos;re testing everything with real people, even those who&apos;ve hardly used a computer.
