	The Levemir Collection&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;making it easy to share information on modern insulins with health&nbsp;professionals
</h1>

<p class="description">Levemir is a modern insulin, a diabetes medicine. Levemir employees were finding it tricky to keep on top of the enormous amount of material relevant available: scientific studies, literature reviews and video tutorials for patients.</p>

<p>My solution was an iPad app that automatically pulls in the latest information and presents it in an easy to understand way. Employees can also share materials with doctors and other health professionals from right within the app. On the basis of this app, The Partners were tasked with a total overhaul of all Levemir materials on both mobile platforms and the company website.</p>
