# Henry's folio, running on jekyll

## Getting started

You'll need three terminal tabs:

* `jekyll build --watch`
* `jekyll serve`
* One more to get your work done

Now open [http://localhost:4000] in your browser.


## SCSS and javascript

SCSS is compiled by jekyll.
Javascript needs to be compiled manually. Try [gpbmike.github.io/refresh-sf](http://gpbmike.github.io/refresh-sf/)
